This is the first blog of the website. 

As I am writing this, it is approaching the end of November, I have finished all of my university exams last
week, in welcoming my long-waited holiday, I been seeing a lot of my friends,
read a few books, start making some travel plans and browsing for my graduation ceremony dress. 

And now, one week after my exams ended, I decided to open my to-do list, things that I always
wanted to do, but got pushed back for a lot of other stuffs in my life. 
And this is how creating a jekyll page and have an online blog came to live.

I intend to use this blog site to document my thoughts and notes as I am learning, 
I vision that there will be technical notes in relating how to make a web app, how
to resolve a technical bug that I have encountered, but it will also have content
relating to other stuffs like how to make a perfect basque cake. 

I plan to fill out this digital space in the next 3 months, hopefully this will become
vibrant digital garden by 2026 Feb :) 🌱
